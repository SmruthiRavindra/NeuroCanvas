NeuroCanvas

"Your emotions are the colors. NeuroCanvas is the brush that helps you paint your inner world."

NeuroCanvas is an emotion-aware AI creative companion that co-creates art, music, and poetry based on the user’s real-time mood.
Unlike traditional AI tools that only respond to text prompts, NeuroCanvas listens to your voice tone, observes behavioral patterns, and detects emotional states — transforming those emotions into creative inspiration.

It’s not here to replace creativity — it’s here to evolve with your emotions, helping you express, explore, and grow through art.

🚀 Key Features
Emotion-Driven Co-Creation

The AI collaborates with you in real time.

Art Mode: Recommends color palettes and brush strokes that match your mood.

Music Mode: Suggests lyrics, chords, and instrumentals based on your humming or tone.

Poetry Mode: Offers emotionally resonant words and themes to co-author with you.

Real-Time Multimodal Analysis

Voice Emotion: Analyzes tone, pitch, energy, and rhythm.

Video Emotion (In-Progress): Detects facial expressions for a more holistic mood reading.

Behavioral Cues: Observes typing rhythm and interaction patterns.

Emotional Safety System

A first-of-its-kind guardian alert system. If prolonged sadness is detected, a gentle, supportive alert is sent to a user-designated guardian to prevent emotional isolation.

Personalized Hobby Discovery

The "Try New with AI" mode suggests new creative hobbies (e.g., painting, journaling, dance) tailored to your mood and declared interests.

🧭 How It Works

NeuroCanvas is built on a simple, powerful loop: Analyze → Adapt → Co-Create.

Analyze: From the moment you start, the app listens to your voice and observes your interactions. It maps cues (e.g., low tone, fast typing) to emotional states (e.g., sadness, anxiety).

Adapt: The AI companion responds instantly. It might change the UI theme to be more calming, recommend a warm color palette, or provide a supportive message.

Co-Create: In the "Creative Hub," the AI provides suggestions that match your emotional state, allowing you to be the main artist while the AI acts as your creative muse.

💖 Emotional Safety: A Core Principle

The Guardian Trigger System is designed with care and responsibility.

It does not act on a single instance of sadness; it confirms patterns across multiple interactions.

The alert sent to the guardian is supportive, not alarming, maintaining user dignity.

Example Message:

"Hey [Guardian Name], [User] might be feeling a little low lately. Maybe a quick message or call from you could brighten their day."

💡 What Makes NeuroCanvas Unique

Human-AI Harmony: The AI collaborates; it never dominates. The human is always the primary artist.

Creative Wellness: This isn't just an art tool; it's a wellness tool that combines self-expression with emotional awareness.

Proactive Support: The guardian system adds a layer of real-world human care that other creative apps lack.
