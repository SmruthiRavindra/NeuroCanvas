Create a new React component called MoodDetector.jsx. This component will have two states: 'idle' and 'analyzing'.

Create the State: Use useState to create a state variable called status, with a default value of 'idle'.

Create the "Idle" UI (the "before" state):

When status is 'idle', display the main UI.

It needs a title: "Detect Your Mood".

It needs a subtitle: "Use your camera to capture your expression, or your microphone to analyze your tone. The AI will analyze your mood."

Show a large, dark container. Inside this container, show a "Camera is off" icon and the text "Click a button to start detection."

Below the container, show two buttons:

A bright pink button with a camera icon that says "Analyze Face".

A dark purple button with a soundwave icon that says "Analyze Voice Only".

Create the "Analyzing" UI (the "after" state):

When the user clicks the "Analyze Face" button, set the status to 'analyzing'.

Add Webcam Functionality:

When the status changes to 'analyzing', you must immediately request webcam access using navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true }).

Get the video stream and display it inside the large container. (Use a <video> tag with autoPlay and muted). This is the "self-view preview".

Add the "Analyzing" Overlay:

While the status is 'analyzing', display an overlay on top of the live video.

This overlay must have a magenta loading spinner and the text "Analyzing your expression...".

Change the Button States:

While status is 'analyzing', the "Analyze Face" button must change. It should become dark purple, be disabled, and show its own small spinner with the text "Analyzing...".

The "Analyze Voice Only" button should also be disabled.

Styling: Use CSS (or styled-components) to create the overall dark mode theme (dark purple background, light text) and the specific pink/magenta accent colors for the buttons and spinners, just like in the screenshots. Use conditional rendering (e.g., {status === 'idle' ? ... : ...}) to show/hide the different UI elements.
